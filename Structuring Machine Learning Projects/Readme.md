This repository contains my certification of completition for the course Structuring Machine Learning Projects taught by Prof Andrew Ng under his Deep Learning Specialization.
It's a course focussed on drilling ideas that'll help you build & lead Machine Learning/Deep Learning Projects. 
My Basic Learning Outcomes from this course:  
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
- Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning
